This is the project from machine learning. My teammates and I created this Fingerprint Power Button, in which the core function is to power on the PC through the correct matching of fingerprint. We coded the Raspberry Pi in python and used it to control the Fingerprint scanner. When the fingerprint is matched, the Raspberry Pi will activate a pin and send the signal to activate the PC motherboard and turn it on.
