prog2_1:


    Imelmented in C++,and will take a single interger N command line argument. The program then perfrom as prog1_6 except it requires re-implement the c++ code with c++ format.


prog2_2:


    It performs the same way as prog2-1 except the program will only accept N correct inputs and then terminate right away instead of waiting till the N input reaches. I created Tokenizer.cpp along with Tokenizer.hpp that count and return numbers of tokens to prog2_2.cpp that deal with error correction, printting stuff, and organizing the return token(s).


prot2_3:


    Implement code and operate it with Stack.cpp and Stack.hpp. By implementing Stack in the program, I am able to function the code as the way the stack function. We push value onto the stack or pop the value out, and the program will follow the rule from prog2_2, in which it will only accept N correct inputs and then prints out the stack status and terminate.
